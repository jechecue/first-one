# Pop-Machina Academy
## Introduction
Hi there.  This is my first page in GitHub made in the context of IAAC Pop-Machina Academy.

In order to try to give it some real content I have added a section with small maker projects.

## Projects
### <a href="./fixing-wifi-repeater/index.html">Fixing a cheap Wi-Fi repeater</a>
In this project you can see how to fix a popular cheap Wi-Fi repeater that tends to fail owing to its power supply module. Repair procedure, components used and references of all the elements are given. This is material suitable for a Repair Cafe that allows avoiding the generation of electronic garbage.
