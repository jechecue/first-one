# Logo MakeSpace
## Introduction
Starting from some requirements in order to make a suitable design of the Logo for Santander's MakerSpace I've made a selection and used several vector and raster editors.

## Requirements and core design
### Visual aspect of the logo
On 2019, Santander adopted an new brand indentity for the city. Basically it is composed by a core idea based on colour strips and the definition of those colors. Therefore, any design should follow the guidelines establised.

### MakerSpace central ideas
Some words arise when thinking about the MakerSpace in the context of Pop-Machina: circular economy, technology, DIY, open (software, hardware,...). 

## Selecting a design software
Following the spirit of MakerSpace it seems appropriate to select a free and preferably open source software.  After analyzing the document comparing vector and raster images, it seems more appropriate to use vector design software for this particular case. 
In addition, I have a personal preference, whenever possible, for using online software. I try to avoid installing many programs on my computer to avoid the typical problems that can occur in Windows.

There are a couple of applications that meet these requirments: 
- <a href="http://vectr.com/"> Vectr </a>
- <a href="http://www.drawsvg.org"> DrawSVG </a> 

## Experiences using the software
### DrawSVG
Really powerful and with a lot of graphic elements Each element is highly configurable and the layers facility is very useful. Its ussability it is not too bad despited its web interface.

### Vectr
Its look&feel seems more simple and prettier but it has less types of shapes to be used.

## Conclusions
It has surprise me that as far as I know, there is no online open source (or at least free) raster editor. The only one I found was Photopea but it is propietary.
