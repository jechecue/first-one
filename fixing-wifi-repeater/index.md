# Fixing cheap Wi-Fi repeater
## Introduction
As it happens to many people I have needed to use Wi-Fi repeaters to reach those points farthest away from my house. Some time ago I bought a couple of cheap Wi-Fi repeaters from a well known Chinese online shop although the same model can be found in other shops.
The installation and start up is very easy and I was very happy with them until one of them started to fail. Initially the communication was interrupted until a moment came when it no longer worked. I thought that the device had lost its configuration but, after doing a reset, the Wi-Fi point that allows you to configure it did not appear, nor did it respond through the Ethernet network connection.
As I had several, I replaced the device with another one and stored the breakdown in case it was useful in the future. After a while, the other one also started to fail and this is something that already alerted my maker sense.
## Fault-finding process
The first thing to say is that when I opened the device I did not intend to fix it. I don't have the patience or the time. As I am very practical, comparing the cost of the device with the cost of my time it is quite possible that it is cheaper to buy another one than to fix it. 
However, satisfying one's curiosity, learning something else, is something that also has its value. In addition, we had to find out the cause of the failure of the devices because it didn't make much sense to buy more if they were really going to fail.
